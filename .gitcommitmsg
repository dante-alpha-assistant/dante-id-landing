fix: add platform-apply endpoint and internal redirect (WP-5/WP-6)

- Add server/platform-apply.js with POST/GET/preview/status endpoints
- Handle both build.files[] and build.content formats for file extraction
- Create GitHub PR against dante-id-landing for internal projects
- Add deployer redirect for type:internal projects -> platform/apply
- Mark projects with internal_applied_at and internal_pr_url on success
